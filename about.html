    <p class="about-text">I was born in Rio, Brazil and always wondered about what to be in life. I thought of being different things, from super heroine to doctor, but clearly none of these options came true. My first real experience was with architecture, after all I didn't play all those hours of the sims in my childhood for anything. But I soon saw that it wasn't exactly what I wanted,I locked my course and I was desperate without knowing what to do, so as the logical solution to existential problems I decided to make my first solo trip. I thought it would be something like Eat, Love and Pray, but unfortunately I didn't find anyone holding a sign saying what I should do with my life. On this trip I discovered two things:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hollywood lies</li>
        <li>My passion is traveling</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="about-text">I went back to Brazil, I graduated in Graphic Design, I entered the job market and saw that it still wasn't exactly what I would like to do, so in the middle of courses and lectures I discovered UX Design and in it a chance to join my creative side and create products, but using my practical side to solve real research-based problems.</p>
    <p class="about-text">So now I'm a digital Product Designer that works on end-to-end projects, from user research to visual design, currently focusing on facilitation as I believe that every problem is better understood and solved with the collaboration of a multidisciplinary team. My passion is to help simplify the complex, always creating solutions that has a positive impact on peopleâ€™s lives.</p>
